# Overview

Small demo that compares denoising methods on an image. It computes PSNR in decibels and SSIM, then renders a clean figure with a table plus two bar charts.

# Data

Use any test image and add noise with your preferred settings. The same noisy input is fed to all methods to keep the comparison fair.

# Methods

* **Noisy Image**
  The unprocessed input used as a baseline.
* **Traditional (Wiener)**
  A classic linear filter that suppresses noise using an estimated local variance.
* **AI (DnCNN)**
  A convolutional neural network trained to predict and remove additive noise.

# Metrics

* **PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio)**
  Measures reconstruction fidelity in dB. Higher is better.
* **SSIM (Structural Similarity Index)**
  Measures perceived structural similarity in the range [0, 1]. Higher is better.

# How to Run

Run your denoising script in MATLAB after computing the metric values for each method. The included figure block at the end of the script creates a UI figure with a table and two bar charts that summarize PSNR and SSIM.

# Reproducibility

Use the same random seed for noise generation and identical preprocessing for all methods. Report the exact noise level and any model or filter parameters.

# Limitations

Results depend on the dataset, noise model, and parameter choices. DnCNN performance can vary with training data and noise level.
